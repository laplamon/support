# DopaGate App Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how DopaGate ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our DopaGate mobile application.

---

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

DopaGate is designed with your privacy in mind. We **do not** collect any personal identifiable information (PII) from you, such as your name, email address, location, or device identifiers that directly identify you. We do not store any of your custom wallpaper images on our servers. All your personal settings and chosen images remain on your device.

## 2. Information Collected by Third-Party Services

### Google AdMob

DopaGate uses Google AdMob, an advertising service provided by Google LLC ("AdMob"). AdMob may collect and use certain information to serve advertisements within the App. This information may include, but is not limited to:

* **Device Information:** Information about your device, such as device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers.
* **Ad Identifiers:** Identifiers such as the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) on iOS, which may be used by AdMob to provide personalized advertising. You can reset your device's advertising identifier or opt out of personalized ads through your device settings.
* **Usage Data:** Information about your interactions with advertisements (e.g., ad impressions, clicks).

AdMob's collection and use of information are governed by Google's Privacy Policy. You can review Google's Privacy Policy at: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

Please note that we do not have control over the information collected by AdMob or how they use it. Their data collection practices are independent of DopaGate.

## 3. External App Launching

DopaGate functions by launching other applications installed on your device after the set waiting period. To perform this function, DopaGate requires permission to interact with other apps on your device. We only use this permission to facilitate the intended functionality of launching your chosen apps. We do not access or collect any data from the external applications you launch through DopaGate.

---

## 4. How We Use Information

As DopaGate does not collect personal identifiable information, we do not use such information. The non-personal information collected by AdMob is used by them for purposes such as:

* Delivering and targeting advertisements.
* Measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
* Providing aggregated reporting to app developers.

## 5. Your Choices and Controls

### Opting Out of Personalized Ads

You can opt out of personalized advertising by Google AdMob by adjusting the privacy settings on your iOS device. For iOS, navigate to `Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking` and disable "Allow Apps to Request to Track" or reset your Advertising Identifier.

### Managing App Permissions

You can manage DopaGate's permissions through your device's settings. If you revoke permissions necessary for DopaGate to launch other apps, the core functionality of the App may be impaired.

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
