# Re\:note App Support

Welcome to the Re\:note Support page! We’re here to help you get the most out of your spaced-review note app.

## What is Re\:note?

Re\:note is a minimalist iOS app that turns saved notes into effortless review. On the weekdays and times you choose, the app sends a notification with **one random note**—showing the title and as much of the body as fits. Tap the alert to open the full note and reinforce your memory in seconds.

## Key Features

* **Random note reminders on your schedule**
* **Title + body editor** that keeps notes focused
* **Lock-screen previews** with title and body snippet
* **One-tap deep link** from notification to the full note
* **Lightweight, distraction-free design** to keep you in flow

## Getting Started

1. **Create your first note**
   Open Re\:note → tap **Add Buttons** → add a clear *Title* and *Body*, then save.

2. **Set your reminder schedule**
   Go to **Remind Schedule** → pick the weekdays and times you’d like notifications.

3. **Review when nudged**
   At each scheduled time, Re\:note selects one note at random and sends a notification. Tap it to review the full note.

## How Notifications Work

* **Selection:** Exactly one saved note is chosen at random at each scheduled reminder.
* **What you’ll see:** The notification includes the note’s **title** and a **body preview** (length depends on iOS display space).
* **Tap-through:** Tapping the notification opens the full note for quick review.
* **Variety:** Random selection means you may see the same note again over time; adding more notes increases variety.
* **Respecting Focus:** iOS Focus/Do Not Disturb may delay or silence alerts based on your device settings.
* **Time zone:** Reminder times follow your device’s current time zone.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I create and organize notes?

Use **New Note** for each idea or highlight. Keep titles short and specific so notifications are instantly recognizable.

### What happens if I have no notes saved?

Re\:note won’t send a notification if there are no notes to select from. Create at least one note to start receiving reminders.

### Why did I see the same note again?

Selection is random. Over time, repeats are normal—especially with a small note set. Add more notes to reduce repeats.

### Can I temporarily pause notifications?

You can turn off reminders in **Remind Schedule** page or adjust iOS **Settings → Notifications → Re\:note**. Focus modes can also silence alerts.

### Will the entire note body show in the notification?

iOS shows a preview. To read everything, tap the notification to open the note in the app.

### Do reminders work offline?

Yes. Scheduled notifications and saved notes work without a network connection.

## Troubleshooting

* **I’m not receiving notifications**

  * Confirm **Settings → Notifications → Re\:note** is allowed.
  * Check **Remind Schedule** in the app and ensure you’ve selected at least one day/time.
  * Review iOS **Focus/Do Not Disturb** settings.
  * Verify your device time and time zone are correct.

* **I’m getting too many/too few reminders**
  Adjust your schedule (days/times) in **Remind Schedule** to match your preference.

* **The notification looks blank or unhelpful**
  Make sure each note has a clear title and a concise first line in the body to improve the preview.
