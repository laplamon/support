# Re\:note App Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how Re\:note (“the App,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) handles information when you use our iOS application.

*Last updated: August 31, 2025*

---

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

Re\:note is built for privacy. We **do not** collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, precise location, or identifiers that directly identify you.
We do not run our own servers to store your notes or schedules.

---

## 2. Data Stored on Your Device (On-Device Processing)

* **Notes & Schedules:** Your notes (title and body) and reminder schedules are saved **locally on your device**.
* **Random Selection:** The choice of which note to notify you about is performed on-device.
* **Deletion:** You can delete notes at any time in the app. Deleting the app removes locally stored app data from your device.
* **Backups:** If you use iOS device backups (e.g., iCloud/Computer backups), your app data may be included in those backups managed by Apple or your device; we do not have access to those backups.

---

## 3. Notifications & Lock Screen Visibility

* **Content Shown:** Notifications may include a note **title** and a **body preview** (as permitted by iOS). This content may be visible on your lock screen depending on your device settings.
* **Controls:** You can manage notification style, previews, and delivery via iOS **Settings → Notifications → Re\:note**, and within the app’s reminder settings.
* **Focus/Do Not Disturb:** iOS Focus or Do Not Disturb may delay or silence notifications.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

Re\:note **does not integrate** third-party analytics or advertising SDKs. If this changes in the future, we will update this policy and, where required, provide an in-app notice.

---

## 5. Permissions We Request

* **Notifications:** Needed to deliver scheduled reminders. You can enable/disable this in iOS Settings or in-app.
  *(Re\:note does not request access to Photos, Contacts, Location, or other sensitive permissions.)*

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

Re\:note is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

---

## 7. Your Choices & Controls

* **Manage Notifications:** Adjust schedules in-app and system settings in iOS.
* **Edit or Delete Notes:** Modify or delete any note at any time.
* **No Tracking:** Because we do not collect your personal data, there is no profile to access, export, or delete on our servers.

---

## 8. Security

Your data stays on your device and benefits from iOS security features (device passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, encrypted device storage). Please keep your device and backups secure.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes are effective when posted on this page. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically.
